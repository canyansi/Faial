&lt;p&gt;Just one problem. You’ve never actually built a drone before. So, umm… actually how do those things get up in the air?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the question I kept coming back to. I really wanted to wrap my head around the concept of flight. And how a drone actually functions. If you’ve ever wondered this, I hope this post can help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;basics-for-flight&quot;&gt;Basics for flight&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I’m concerned, in order for any aerial vehicle to function, it needs to satisfy 3 basic requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flight mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Energy to power itself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A brain to control everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. Well, 4 things if you include a body to house everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;flight-mechanism&quot;&gt;Flight mechanism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many methods to propel a device off the ground. A bird has wings, a plane also has wings of sorts. When we jump we use energy from our legs to project us up. The method a drone flies is by pushing air downwards. Imagine a small fan facing downwards. Now imagine multiple of them connected by a piece of cardboard. That’s basically a drone. Spinning blades push the air in a certain direction. The ‘fans’ of a drone are called rotors, and they work basically the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;energy&quot;&gt;Energy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well if you have a fan, how do you get it to spin on it’s own? Just like you plug in your fan, the aerial vehicle needs a power source. It would be inconvenient for the vehicle to be wired all the time, so naturally a battery is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;brain&quot;&gt;Brain&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great! It has a way to fly and energy to make it fly…But how does it know what to do or where to go? It needs a central area that is in charge of moving the rotors to control flight, and doing any other tasks that you want a drone to do. This is the brain’s of the vehicle and it’s called the flight controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it. A drone! Of course there’s other things that go into making a drone, but these are the 3 central parts. Everything else revolves around enhancing these parts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>christine</name></author><category term="starting" /><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">After watching beautiful footage from drone videos, observing their gain in popularity over the years, and possibly even seeing one in real life you come up with the best idea ever - you’re gonna build a drone!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Getting started</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/starting/blog/2021/04/13/Planning.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Getting started" /><published>2021-04-13T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-04-13T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/starting/blog/2021/04/13/Planning</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/starting/blog/2021/04/13/Planning.html">&lt;p&gt;Neither of us knew much about electronics, so our first step was to read as much as possible about drones. We came across a great deal of blogs, acronyms, and formats to create a drone, one subtype of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Here are a subset of things we considered during our first steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-many-drones&quot;&gt;How many drones?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fiddled with the idea of simultaneously working on two drones, but decided perhaps it’s best to focus on one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-kind-of-drone&quot;&gt;What kind of drone?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ultimately decided on a quadcopter (a UAV with four rotors), as it seemed to be the most standard model&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-manage-our-project&quot;&gt;How to manage our project?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We settled on using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.todoist.com/&quot;&gt;todoist&lt;/a&gt; to track responsibilities and share tasks. Todoist is basically as it’s name sounds. An app that enables simple to do lists in a clean fashion. So far it has worked well for us. We used a google drive folder to share documents and links&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;which-sites-were-the-most-helpful&quot;&gt;Which sites were the most helpful?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most helpful source for us was this &lt;a href=&quot;http://beginnerflyer.com/build-a-drone/&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that went over everything on how to build a drone from scratch. This was basically our guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K05UwsiqZ_E&quot;&gt;Drone parts 101&lt;/a&gt; This youtube video gave me a pretty good overview of the different parts of the drone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this information in the next blog post, I’ll answer the biggest question that was on my mind during these early days….how the heck does a drone work?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="starting" /><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">Neither of us knew much about electronics, so our first step was to read as much as possible about drones.
