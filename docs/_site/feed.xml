We came across a great deal of blogs, acronyms, and formats to create a drone, one subtype of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Here are a subset of things we considered during our first steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-many-drones&quot;&gt;How many drones?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fiddled with the idea of simultaneously working on two drones, but decided perhaps it’s best to focus on one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-kind-of-drone&quot;&gt;What kind of drone?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ultimately decided on a quadcopter (a UAV with four rotors), as it seemed to be the most standard model&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-manage-our-project&quot;&gt;How to manage our project?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We settled on using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.todoist.com/&quot;&gt;todoist&lt;/a&gt; to track responsibilities and share tasks. Todoist is basically as it’s name sounds. An app that enables simple to do lists in a clean fashion. So far it has worked well for us. We used a google drive folder to share documents and links&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;which-sites-were-the-most-helpful&quot;&gt;Which sites were the most helpful?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most helpful source for us was this &lt;a href=&quot;http://beginnerflyer.com/build-a-drone/&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that went over everything on how to build a drone from scratch. This was basically our guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K05UwsiqZ_E&quot;&gt;Drone parts 101&lt;/a&gt; This youtube video gave me a pretty good overview of the different parts of the drone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this information in the next blog post, I’ll answer the biggest question that was on my mind during these early days….how the heck does a drone work?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="starting" /><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">Neither of us knew much about electronics, so our first step was to read as much as possible about drones.
