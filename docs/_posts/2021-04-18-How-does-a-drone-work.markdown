After watching beautiful footage from drone videos, observing their gain in popularity over the years, and possibly even seeing one in real life you come up with the best idea ever - you're gonna build a drone! 

Just one problem. You've never actually built a drone before. So, umm... actually how do those things get up in the air? 

This was the question I kept coming back to. I really wanted to wrap my head around the concept of flight. And how a drone actually functions. If you've ever wondered this, I hope this post can help you.


# Basics for flight
As far as I'm concerned, in order for any aerial vehicle to function, it needs to satisfy 3 basic requirements.

- Flight mechanism
- Energy to power itself
- A brain to control everything

That's it. Well, 4 things if you include a body to house everything. 

# Mechanical Wings

There are many methods to propel a device off the ground.  


What's up alexey.!!!
