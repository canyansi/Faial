After watching beautiful footage from drone videos, observing their gain in popularity over the years, and possibly even seeing one in real life you come up with the best idea ever - you're gonna build a drone! 

Just one problem. You've never actually built a drone before. So, umm... actually how do those things get up in the air? 

This was the question I kept coming back to. I really wanted to wrap my head around the concept of flight. And how a drone actually functions. If you've ever wondered this, I hope this post can help you.


# Basics for flight
As far as I'm concerned, in order for any aerial vehicle to function, it needs to satisfy 3 basic requirements.

- Flight mechanism
- Energy to power itself
- A brain to control everything

That's it. Well, 4 things if you include a body to house everything. 

# Flight mechanism

There are many methods to propel a device off the ground. A bird has wings, a plane also has wings of sorts. When we jump we use energy from our legs to project us up. The method a drone flies is by pushing air downwards. Imagine a small fan facing downwards. Now imagine multiple of them connected by a piece of cardboard. That's basically a drone. Spinning blades push the air in a certain direction. The 'fans' of a drone are called rotors, and they work basically the same. 

# Energy

Well if you have a fan, how do you get it to spin on it's own? Just like you plug in your fan, the aerial vehicle needs a power source. It would be inconvenient for the vehicle to be wired all the time, so naturally a battery is used. 

# Brain

Great! It has a way to fly and energy to make it fly...But how does it know what to do or where to go? It needs a central area that is in charge of moving the rotors to control flight, and doing any other tasks that you want a drone to do. This is the brain's of the vehicle and it's called the flight controller.


There you have it. A drone! Of course there's other things that go into making a drone, but these are the 3 central parts. Everything else revolves around enhancing these parts.
