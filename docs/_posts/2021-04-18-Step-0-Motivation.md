Neither of us knew much about electronics, so our first step was to read as much as possible about drones. We came across a great deal of blogs, acronyms, and formats to create a drone, one subtype of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Here are a subset of things we considered during our first steps. 


# How many drones?

We fiddled with the idea of simultaneously working on two drones, but decided perhaps it's best to focus on one.

# What kind of drone?

We ultimately decided on a quadcopter (a UAV with four rotors), as it seemed to be the most standard model

# How to manage our project?
We settled on using [todoist](https://www.todoist.com/) to track responsibilities and share tasks. Todoist is basically as it's name sounds. An app that enables simple to do lists in a clean fashion. So far it has worked well for us. We used a google drive folder to share documents and links

# Which sites were the most helpful?

The most helpful source for us was this [tutorial](http://beginnerflyer.com/build-a-drone/) that went over everything on how to build a drone from scratch. This was basically our guide.

[Drone parts 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K05UwsiqZ_E) This youtube video gave me a pretty good overview of the different parts of the drone.

Based on this information in the next blog post, I'll answer the biggest question that was on my mind during these early days....how the heck does a drone work?
