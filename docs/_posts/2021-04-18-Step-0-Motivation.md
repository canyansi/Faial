Neither of us knew much about electronics, so our first step was to read as much as possible about drones. We came across a great deal of blogs, acronyms, and formats to create a drone, one subtype of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Here are decisions we made along the way. 

# Which sites were the most helpful?

The most helpful source for us was this [tutorial](http://beginnerflyer.com/build-a-drone/) that went over everything on how to build a drone from scratch. This was basically our guide.

[Drone parts 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K05UwsiqZ_E) This youtube video gave me a pretty good overview of the different parts of the drone.


# How to manage our project?
We settled on using [todoist](todoist.com/) to track responsibilities and share tasks. Todoist is basically as it's name sounds. An app that enables simple to do lists in a clean fashion. So far it has worked well for us. We used a google drive folder to share documents and links

# How many drones?

We fiddled with the idea of simultaneously working on two drones, but decided perhaps it's best to focus on one.
