# Why make a drone?
Well... We were bored and thought why not? Drone's are affordable and appeared relatively straight forward to make. We've got no electronics background but we thought it might be fun. 

# Why make this blog?
We wanted to document our process for ourselves and also others who might find themselves with the same kind of curiosity we had. Also, like most people, sometimes laziness grabs a hold of us. Making a blog allows us to be more accountable. 

# What will be in the blog?
The blog will contain our thought processes, learnings, decisions, failures and successes along the way to making our drone.

# What's Faial?
Faial is the name of our first drone. When thinking of what to call it, we decided to go with island names. Since we both loved spending time in the Azores, a archipelago of Portuguese islands 2 hours from the coast,  we decided our first drone will be named Faial.
